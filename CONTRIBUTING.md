Thank you for your interest in WikiToLearn Hives :tada:!

> We believe that Open Education is great, and its development needs to be fostered.

We work with open source/education enthusiasts to build WikiToLearn Hives
so that students, teachers and researchers can build free educational material
for the web and the tools that help this creation.

## Creating a hive

To create a hive, you need to send a pull request. Here's how to do so:

1. **[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository**. This makes your own version of this project you can edit.
2. **[Make your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes)**! You should create a file in the `hives` folder to represent your hive. Feel free to use [this template](https://github.com/WikiToLearn/Hives-Network/blob/master/hives/000-Sample.md) to start off your work.
3. **Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)**. This opens a ticket and lets the rest of the community know that your hive is up for business!

The hives coordinator will get in touch with you and hopefully accept your pull request. From that point, you will be a Hive leader! :tada:

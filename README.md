# Hives-Network

**We believe that Open Education is great. We work with open source/education enthusiasts to build local communities so that students, teachers and researchers can build free educational material for the web, together with the tools that help this creation.**

The WikiToLearn Hives Network is a network of local communities which promote
the creation and sharing of free educational material. It also acts as a local
"chapter" of WikiToLearn, facilitating the participation of new contributors, and introducing new people to the idea of open learning.

### Structure of a hive

This structure is the basic unit for the local teams of WikiToLearn.

* **Hive leader**: The point of contact with the rest of WikiToLearn project.
* (optional) **Hive executive team**: A group of people who help the leader run the hive.
* **Hive contributor**: The main contributor of the hive. Takes care of running the events and attracting new people in the creation of Open Collaborative Educational Resources.

### Every hive has:

* **A chat room on the [main WikiToLearn chat](https://chat.wikitolearn.org)**: The naming scheme is #h-`<hive name>`. We will create one for you upon approval of your hive.
* **Blog account**: An official account on https://blogs.wikitolearn.org.
* **[Meta](https://meta.wikitolearn.org) page** (optional): A meta page to act as homepage

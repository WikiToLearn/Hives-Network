# Hives-Network
The Network of WikiToLearn Hives.


> We believe that Open Education is great, and its development needs to be fostered.

We work with open source/education enthusiasts to build WikiToLearn Hives
so that students, teachers and researchers can build free educational material
for the web and the tools that help this creation.

The WikiToLearn Hives Network is a network of local communities which promote
the creation and sharing of free educational material. It also acts as a local
"chapter" of WikiToLearn.



### Structure of a hive

# The network of Open Education Hives

**We believe that Open Education is great. We work with open source/education enthusiasts to build local communities so that students, teachers and researchers can build free educational material for the web, together with the tools that help this creation.**

The WikiToLearn Open Education Hives Network is a network of local communities which promote
the creation and sharing of free educational material. It also acts as a local
"chapter" of WikiToLearn, facilitating the participation of new contributors, and introducing new people to the idea of open learning.

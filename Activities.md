# Activities

As a participant in a hive, you need to engage and create a few activities around your local group.
Remember that your aim is to create a group where people have fun creating some great educational material.

# The basics
A hive is meant to be first and foremost an offline community. Humans tend to bond very well while in person, and you can exploit this natural behiavour to your advantage.

Ask yourself: is there a place and time which is a natural meeting place for the community of my hive?

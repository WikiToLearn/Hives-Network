# Activities

As a participant in a hive, you need to engage and create a few activities around your local group.
Remember that your aim is to create a group where people have fun creating some great educational material.

# The basics
A hive is meant to be first and foremost a community which meets in real life. Humans tend to bond very well while in person, and you can exploit this natural behiavour to your advantage.

Ask yourself: is there a place and time which is a natural meeting place for the community of my hive? It could be a University pub, a lecture hall, an office or simply a public space. This place should be a starting point for your community to start gathering. Set up informal meetings, preferrably around food, and start meeting.
